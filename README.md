# algolab2019

This repository contains my solutions to the problems presented in [Algorithm's Lab](https://www.cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS19/algolab/index.html) 2019. 

# Run the solution
To test a solution, compile the `main.cpp` file in e.g `potw1/main.cpp` and run it on the test cases, found in `potw1/testcases/` by:
```
$ make test
```

This will print to `stdout` whether or `main.cpp` gives the right output for the different test cases - or the difference it will have on them individually.
